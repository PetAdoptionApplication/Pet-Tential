# Pet-Tential

Pet-Tential is a full stack web application that allows Shelters and potential adopters a better means to connect. With this we hope to drastically increase adoption rates for shelters and hopefully find furrever homes for our furry buddies.

## Features

- Save time by creating preferences. This way anytime a pet becomes available that matches your choices you will instantly be notified via text message!
